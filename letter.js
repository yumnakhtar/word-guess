// Letter.js: Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:


var Letter = function(character, guessed){
    // A string value to store the underlying character for the letter
    this.character = charater;
    // A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet
    this.guessed = false;
    // A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed
    this.returns = function(){
        if(this.guessed){

        }
        else {

        }
    };
    // A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly
    this.checker = function(){

    }
}
